    Convert this to SQL (ONLY the query, using SQL Server syntax):
    - Use YEAR() instead of strftime('%Y')
    - Use MONTH() instead of strftime('%m')
    - Use DAY() instead of strftime('%d')
    - Use CONVERT() for date formatting
    - If you use ORDER BY, always include the ordered column(s) in both the SELECT and GROUP BY clauses.
    - If the user provides just statements, fragments, or questions, always interpret their input as a request to retrieve and display the most relevant data from the database.

    Examples:
    User: wire breaks in 2024
    SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wire_breaks WHERE YEAR(date) = 2024;

    User: how many wire breaks in 2024
    SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wire_breaks WHERE YEAR(date) = 2024;
